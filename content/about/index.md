## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am an independent Apple Developer with a focus on iOS platform. Currently, I am building **KartStopper**, a productivity app to craft the perfect shopping plan. 

Previously, I have worked as a full-time Business Analyst for a brief period in 2021-22 with experience spanning across Real Estate, Logistics, Media, Energy, Retail and Credit sectors. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai.

I have an affinity towards all things neat and serene. When I'm not coding, I love to work in my garden or pick an interesting book to read.

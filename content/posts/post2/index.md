A steady influx of college-educated Indian workers to US has never bode well with struggling Americans. The growing resentment was still not potent enough to be at loggerheads with a thriving corporate atmosphere enabled by reduced labour costs. It remained so until the recent [announcement of yet another exorbitant levy](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-says-imposition-one-time-fee-h1b-visas-causes-disruptions-2025-09-26) on **H1B** visa applicants by US government. [The Immigration Act of 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1990) was introduced in US to compensate for labour shortage by allowing employment based immigration with provision of administrative naturalization.

Since the announcement, Corporate America is full of trepidation over the President's *"no free lunch"* diktat. The clarifications made by White House did bring some relief to existing **H1B** holders as they learnt that they are exempted from its scope. However, it is the US startups among the worst hit as they would no longer be able to afford hiring workers abroad. Perhaps, the best talent has already settled itself at a more conducive ecosystem. India on the other hand has very little to benefit from the move as India's best talent would manage to find another attractive destination to venture. The key factor for return to India appears to be rise in hate crimes against Indian diasphora driven by the resentment among the jobless youth abroad.

## Is AI hallucinating or the companies which believe it can replace workers?

Artificial Intelligence has [not yet lived up to its promise](https://futurism.com/six-months-anthropic-coding) of replacing workers. Corporates are eager to fire their bloated workforce under the pretext of AI agents take over only to realize their blunders later. They often fallback on legacy systems as AI has led to slower turnaround. [GenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) tools aren't generating production ready code. Teams would suffer because of the repeated verifications required in the process. The results are exactly opposite of the promise. Citizens from all walks of life are [equally affected](https://tech.co/news/list-ai-failures-mistakes-errors).

Investors in US are making huge bets based on AI hype. The phenomenon shares its characteristics with the **dot com bubble** of the early 2000s when every startup would attach a '.com' after its name to get a higher valuation. Eventually only a very few players survived who came to be known as **Big Tech**.

## Startup India

Indian IT giants such as **TCS** who have laid off thousands of employees seem to have taken advantage of the AI hype and use it as an opportunity to shed off excess fat. The looming mass unemployement is a recipe for [Nepal like GenZ protests](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/09/asia/nepal-protests-social-media-ban-explainer-intl-hnk) which has inspired similar events in France and Peru. 

New Delhi is seen championing the likes of **Zoho** which has a reputation of leading **CRM** (Customer Relationship Management) sector. Apart from **UPI** led by government through PPP (private public partnership) model, the startup ecosystem is yet to produce a profitable product independent of foreign aid which can compete on the global stage. There is a dearth of indegenous servers which can replace **AWS** or **Google Cloud** and an indegenous smartphone brand premium enough to be gifted to sitting MPs in the parliament instead of the latest **Apple iPhone PRO** or **Google Pixel PRO** models.

Given that AI does not bother consent when it comes to securing data and can be seen leaking it freely, it poses a huge risk when [implemented across India Stack](https://pn.ispirt.in/depa-ai-chain-empowerment-through-provenance). There is a need to curb AI penetration across systems and contain its spread. It is after all, till date, a system under test.

## Welcome to my blog!

This is my first ever blog. In about 60 minutes from the time of this writing, iPhone 17 will be unveiled to the public. Liquid Glass has left me dissapointed and reluctant to switch in my designs. It is reminiscent of Cydia tweaks applied to jailbroken devices during iOS 6 days.

I have been learning SwiftUI for about a year now. If you've seen my [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), I'm aiming to publish an open-source app very soon. I would refrain from experimenting with Liquid Glass as the app is focused on productivity and finance. The last thing I would want is users having problems with illegible text.

Having presented the iPhone 17 lineup, it appears that Apple deliberately wants us to choose 17 Pro over the Air variant. It took me by surprise that Air being priced the same as last year's 16 Pro features only a single camera! It has all the telltale signs of why one should avoid buying it. The red flags start right from its uncanny resemblence to the Google Pixel 10 Pro and a battery capacity lower than the base iPhone 17 model.

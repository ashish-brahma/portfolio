## Welcome to my blog!

This is my first ever blog. I have been learning SwiftUI for about a year now. If you've seen my [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), you would know that I'm aiming to publish an open-source app very soon. 

Since its introduction at WWDC earlier this year, Liquid Glass design material has left me dissapointed and reluctant to switch. It is reminiscent of Cydia tweaks applied to jailbroken devices during iOS 6 days. I would refrain from experimenting with this new design as my app is focused on productivity and finance. The last thing I would want is users having problems with illegible text.

Today, [iPhone 17 has been unveiled](https://nr.apple.com/Ds9e0K5aD8) to the public. Having presented the iPhone 17 lineup, it appears that Apple deliberately wants users to choose 17 Pro over the Air variant. It took me by surprise that Air, being priced the same as last year's 16 Pro, features only a single camera! It has all the telltale signs of why one should avoid buying it. The red flags start right from its uncanny resemblence to the Google Pixel 10 series and a battery capacity lower than the base variant of iPhone 17 series.

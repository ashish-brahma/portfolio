## Welcome to my blog!

This is my first ever blog. I have been learning `SwiftUI` for about a year now. If you've seen my [projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), you would know that I'm aiming to publish an open-source app very soon. 

Since its introduction at **WWDC** earlier this year, *Liquid Glass* design material has left me dissapointed and reluctant to switch. It is reminiscent of **Cydia** tweaks applied to jailbroken devices during **iOS 6** days. I would refrain from experimenting with this new design as my app is focused on productivity and finance. The last thing I would want is users having problems with illegible text.

Today, **iPhone 17** has been unveiled to the public. Having presented the **iPhone 17** lineup, it appears that **Apple** deliberately wants users to choose the costlier **17 Pro** over the **Air** variant. It took me by surprise that **Air**, being priced the same as last year's **16 Pro**, features only a single camera! It has all the telltale signs of why one should avoid buying it. The red flags start right from its uncanny resemblence to the **Google Pixel 10** series and a battery capacity lower than the base variant of **iPhone 17** series.

Interestingly, **AirPods Pro 3** now come with Live Translation feature to help people who speak different languages communicate with each other in their native tongue. They sport *clinical grade* [^1]  hearing-aids same as last year along with a new heart rate sensor. Despite recent [lawsuits](https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute) surrounding **Apple Watch Series 9** and **Ultra 2**, the tech giant has been able to make a comeback with a redesigned Blood Oxygen monitoring sensor in compliance with a local US Court ruling.

With these refreshments, **Apple** hopes to turn around its perception of introducing cosmetic upgrades each year. They made sure to emphasize their stance throughout the launch event. The average consumer on the other hand would definitely take note of the decoy pulled off out of thin air.ðŸ˜‰
